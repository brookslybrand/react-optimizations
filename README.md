## History of this repository

This is the repository for a video series I'm working on showing different optimization strategies in React

This is a fork of another repository I used for a demo of the library [immer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/immer) at [Austin Downtown React Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-ATX/?_af_cid=ReactJS-ATX&_xtd=gatlbWFpbF9jbGlja9oAJDU5ZjIwZDRmLTFiNzItNGUyNC1iZWQ1LTNmYjY3ZTI5MGY2OQ&_af=chapter) for the August, 2019 meetup.

You can view the [original repo here](https://github.com/brookslybrand/immer-talk)

_Bootstraped with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev)_
